<h4> What is <a class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview" target="_blank">Global Warming?</a></h4> <br>
        <p><a class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview" target="_blank">Global Warming</a> is a phenomenon of climate change by a general increase in average temperatures of the Earth, which modifies the weather balances and ecosystems for a long time. Glaciers melting, sea levels rising, cloud forests are dying and the wildlife is struggling to keep up at this pace. It is directly linked to the increase of <a  class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gases</a> in our atmosphere, worsening the greenhouse effect. At the pace of current CO2 emissions, scientists expect an increase of between 1.5° and 5.3°C (34.7° to 41.5°F) in average temperature by 2100. If no action is taken, it would have harmful consequences to humanity and the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/biosphere/#:~:text=Encyclopedic%20Entry%20Vocabulary-,The%20biosphere%20is%20made%20up%20of%20the%20parts%20of%20Earth,rain%20forests%20and%20high%20mountaintops.&text=The%20Earth's%20water%E2%80%94on%20the,air%E2%80%94makes%20up%20the%20hydrosphere." class="gwa" target="_blank">biosphere.</a> Since 1870, sea levels have risen about 8 inches higher because of global warming.   </p>

This increases the chance of getting diseases. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/#:~:text=Global%20warming%20is%20the%20long,gas%20levels%20in%20Earth's%20atmosphere." class="gwa" target="_blank">Global Warming</a>  affects the air we breathe and can affect the water we drink too. The increase of temperatures and the climate change disturb the <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://youmatter.world/en/definition/ecosystem-definition-example/">ecosystems</a>, cycles of plant reproduction. The scarcity of resources and climate change are changing life habits and migratory cycles of animals. We are already witnessing the disappearance of many species - including endemic species - or, conversely that threaten crops and other animals. <a class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview" target="_blank">Global Warming</a> therefore impacts biodiversity. At present the increasing in temperature of 1.5°C (34.7°F) average rise might put 20-30% of species at risk  of extinction. If the planet warms by more than 2°C most <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://youmatter.world/en/definition/ecosystem-definition-example/">ecosystems</a> will struggle. Because of <a class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview" target="_blank">global warming</a>, the ice is melting massively at the poles, increasing the sea level at a rate beyond expectations.

Also effecting fishes, seashells or coral reefs. Effecting Human beings in large scale in many ways. Climate change is affecting the global economy. It is already shaking up social, health and geopolitical balances in many parts of the world. The scarcity of resources like food and energy gives rise to new conflicts.

<h4>What Causes Global Warming?</h4>
<p>The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon. However, the increase in greenhouse gases is linked to human activities. The main cause of global warming since the mid-twentieth century, mostly because of: <br> <br>
    <b>• <a target="_blank" class="gwa" ref="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fossil-fuels/">Fossil Fuels.</a> </b> The massive use of <a target="_blank" class="gwa" ref="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fossil-fuels/">fossil fuels</a> is obviously the first source of global warming, as burning coal, oil and gas produces Carbon dioxide - the most important <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gas</a> in the atmosphere - as well as nitrous oxide. <br> <br> <b>• <a href="https://youmatter.world/en/definition/definitions-what-is-definition-deforestation-causes-effects/" class="gwa" target="_blank">Deforstation</a></b> The exploitation of forests has a major role in climate change. Trees help regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When they are cut down, this positive effect is lost and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon#:~:text=Carbon%20(from%20Latin%3A%20carbo%20%22,0.025%20percent%20of%20Earth's%20crust." class="gwa" target="_blank">carbon</a> stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere. <br> <br> <b>• Intensive Farming</b> Another cause of <a class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview" target="_blank">global warming</a> is intensive farming, not only with the ever-increasing livestock, but also with plant protection products and fertilizers. In fact, cattle and sheep produce large amounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane#:~:text=Methane%20(US%3A%20%2F%CB%88m,main%20constituent%20of%20natural%20gas.&text=When%20methane%20reaches%20the%20surface,is%20known%20as%20atmospheric%20methane." class="gwa" target="_blank">methane</a> when digesting their food, while fertilizers produce <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide">nitrous oxide</a> emissions. <br> <br> <b>• Mining</b> Modern life is highly dependent on the mining industry. Metals and minerals are the raw materials used in the construction, transportation and manufacturing of goods. This mining sector accounts for 5% of all <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. For decades now, <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology">meteorologists</a> and <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology">climatologists</a> around the world have been watching the effects of global warming on the weather phenomena. And the impact is huge: more droughts and heatwaves, more precipitations, more natural disasters like floods, hurricanes, storms and wildfires, frost-free season, etc.

                <h4> <b>What are the solutions to prevent this?</b> </h4><br>
                <p> <b>• Power your home with <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20is%20energy%20that,%2C%20waves%2C%20and%20geothermal%20heat.&text=About%2020%25%20of%20humans'%20global,including%20almost%2030%25%20of%20electricity.">renewable energy</a> .</b>The first way to prevent climate change is to move away from fossil fuels. What are the alternatives? Renewable energies like solar, wind, biomass and geothermal.  Powering your home with renewable is not only good for your electricity bills but also good for the environment. Since solar and wind power is free, we would not need to burn any <a target="_blank" class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fossil-fuels/">fossil fuels</a>  to get electricity. If you still choose <a target="_blank" class="gwa" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fossil-fuels/">fossil fuels</a>, the amount of <a  class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gasses</a> released would be unreal. If we continue to do this, we could reach upto 3°c which can affect the planet in terrible ways, such as frequent hurricanes and storms to baking heatwaves almost everyday! <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20is%20energy%20that,%2C%20waves%2C%20and%20geothermal%20heat.&text=About%2020%25%20of%20humans'%20global,including%20almost%2030%25%20of%20electricity.">Renewable energy</a> also gives jobs and economic devlopment for the ever-expanding world for the creating, installing and more, Benefiting the entire world and the people. <br><br> <b>• Reduce water waste.</b> Producing clean energy is essential, but reducing our consumption of energy and water by using more efficient devices (e.g. LED light bulbs, innovative shower systems) is less costly and equally important. Reducing water waste is a way of reducing <a target="_blank"class="gwa" href="https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/makingsciencepublic/2015/08/06/carbon-pollution/#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20'carbon,global%20warming%20or%20climate%20change.">carbon pollution</a> . It takes a lot of pump, heat and energy to treat your water well. So, turn of the taps while your brushing your teeth and take shorter showers or switch to Water Sensible water appliances. It basically reduces the emissions of <a target="_blank" class="gwa" href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">greenhouse gasses</a>  so it avoids generating heat to heat the water itself. You may also want to reduce water wastage for your power bills for using less energy to pump and heat the water. <br> <br> <b>• Buy better bulbs. </b>LED lightbulbs use up to 80 percent less energy than conventional incandescents. They’re also cheaper in the long run. The 10-watt LED can replace your normal 60-watt bulb and can save you upto 125$ for it total bulb-span. The reason to buy better bulbs is because lighting contributes to 6% of the whole greenhouse gasses. LED lights could take the greenhouse gas out of air and would reduce the number of power houses. <br> <br> <b>• Drive a fuel-efficient vehicle.</b> Promoting public transportation, carpooling, but also electric and hydrogen mobility, can definitely help reduce CO2 emissions and thus fight global warming. Gas-smart cars such as <a  class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle">hybrids</a> and <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car">electric cars</a>  are best to drive now. They save fuel, money and the environment because <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car"></a> electric cars do not emit carbon dioxide or <a class="gwa" target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-overview">greenhouse gasses</a>  which is the main reason of global warming. Vehicles with petrol or diesel usually release about 1.6 billion tons of greenhouse gasses each year, mostly in the forn of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) contributing to the environment in a terrible way.  </p> <br>
